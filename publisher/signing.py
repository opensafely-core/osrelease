    need to be random. It acts to partition signatures between use cases that
    shared the same secret_key.

    The length of secret_key and salt together should be more than the digest
    size, which for sha256 is 32 bytes.

    See https://itsdangerous.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/concepts/ for more info.

    """A signed auth token.

    The signed format is a json serialized version of this model, with
    a signature.

    This model includes all the logic needed to generate, sign, parse and
    validate a signed auth token. This is so that we can ensure that it is very
    difficult to create an invalid token by accident, and so in future we can
    share one implementation of this token between projects.

    Note: we sign the full url, rather than including business concepts like
    'workspace' or 'release', and signing those. The assumption here is that
    the url path will include a business scope, e.g.
    `https://example.com/workspaces/MYWORKSPACE`, and that all urls under this
    prefix are valid for this token.

    This gives us a few benefits:

    1) more generic token format that can be used on different parts of the system.
    2) including the full domain prevents cross backend token usage
    3) validating the url makes it easier for web frameworks to automatically
       apply the validation, as they don't need to understand the business logic.
